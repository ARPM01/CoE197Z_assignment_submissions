# FasterRCNN_finetuned
Created by Adonais Ray Maclang. Finetuning the Faster RCNN Objection Detection Model using the drinks dataset.
To train, unzip the drinks dataset into the folder(https://bit.ly/adl2-ssd) and run train.py. To see results on test_split, run test.py. Alternatively, view the Google Colab Notebooks. 

See releases for the pre-trained weights and the dataset.

Faster R-CNN is an objection detection model that extracts features using a pre-trained CNN.
